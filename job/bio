Senior SRE in Retail Technologies Infrastructure Team

I've spent the last 6 years automating everything from business processes 
to build automation and the resulting configuration management it drives.

I'm a huge fan of automation and inclusion. No procedure with more than 
3 steps should ever be keyed more than 3 times before its automated.  

I have 2 acres of land in the beaufiful Santa Cruz mountains and spend 
most of my free time tending the land, my flock of birds and my pride of cats. 
Sometimes I get to kayak! 

Now let go automate ;)
